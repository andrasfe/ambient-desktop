{"id":"ambient-desktop-cl4","title":"Fix UI layout expansion and timeout for large extractions","description":"Two issues reported:\n\n1. **UI Layout Expansion** (RESOLVED):\n   - Chat panel expanded horizontally when browser-use ran, pushing Activity Log off screen\n   - Root cause: CDP Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride affects all Chrome tabs\n   - Fix: Added overflow-hidden to Chat, ActivityLog, AgentPanel components\n   - Workaround: Use Firefox/Safari for frontend when browser-use controls Chrome\n   - Added message truncation in websocket.py to prevent long content\n\n2. **Timeout for Large Extractions** (PARTIALLY RESOLVED):\n   - Original 5-minute timeout too short for 83+ patents\n   - Increased to 30 minutes, but still not enough\n   - Root cause: browser-use LLM calls via OpenRouter take 30-60s each\n   - Extracting 83 patents requires 50+ steps = 25+ minutes\n   - Added LLM timeout increase (60s → 180s)\n   - Added fast path for LinkedIn patents (direct DOM scraping) but doesn't trigger on wrong tab\n   - Needs: Either faster LLM or smarter extraction strategy","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-24T12:25:43.272967-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T15:20:17.980637-07:00","comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"ambient-desktop-cl4","author":"andraslferenczi","text":"Progress update:\n\n1. **UI Layout Issue**: Fixed with overflow-hidden CSS on Chat, ActivityLog, AgentPanel.

But still not enough for 83+ patents extraction.\n\n3. **Root Cause of Slowness**: browser-use LLM calls via OpenRouter take 30-60+ seconds each. Extracting 83 patents requires 50+ steps = 25+ minutes total.\n\n4. **Attempted Fixes**:\n   - Increased LLM timeout from 60s to 180s\n   - Added fast path for LinkedIn patents (direct DOM scraping)\n   - Fast path doesn't trigger when browser starts on wrong tab\n\n5. **Current State**: Extraction still takes too long (30+ min). Needs optimization of extraction strategy or faster LLM.","created_at":"2025-12-24T22:20:08Z"}]}
